                    Hair loss is very common among millions of Americans. Unfortunately, about 40 million bald men in the United States spend over $1 billion fighting baldness every year, and an average of 1 in 4 women suffers from hair loss.
                    <br><br>
                    When we hear people talking about hair loss, we mostly think of men. But female hair loss is as real. Women also endure noticeable hair thinning at some point in their lives. These women tend to feel isolated even more than men facing similar issues.

                    There are many types of hair loss; therefore, finding the reasons for hair loss remains a challenge. Hair loss doesn‚Äôt happen suddenly, but it is instead the result of ongoing miniaturization of specific hair follicles. With time, hairs will become smaller and thinner, until they will ultimately stop growing.
                    <br><br>
                    Most hair loss is linked to some internal disease, and poor nutrition. In some cases, genetic factors and the natural aging process may cause hair loss in women and men. Many people start noticing mild hair thinning in their early 30s and 40s. Life issues, illnesses, unbalanced diet, emotional trauma, hormonal changes during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, may also cause excessive hair shedding.

                    The causes of hair loss in women can vary. Female hair loss is mostly hereditary, and the female hair pattern is more diffuse with fewer chances of frontal hair loss. Some women may start noticing hair thinning in their 20s, but this is a slow process, which may take years before it becomes noticeable. Age is among the hair loss causes to consider as many women in their mid-30s are more prone to lose their hair.
                    <br><br>
                    Some conditions such as anemia and thyroid disease may also accelerate hair loss in women. Nonetheless, these conditions can be diagnosed and treated. Some studies suggest that female pattern baldness is mostly inherited from the mother, but these studies aren‚Äôt very reliable hence requiring further testing. Repeat hair trauma that causes constant friction may also lead to localized hair shedding in some women, particularly those who pull their hair tightly in a rubber band.

                    There are many reasons why men start losing their hair at an early age. If this is you, don‚Äôt panic! You may feel there is nothing you can do to avoid genetic hair loss. But stress can only complicate things further. In fact, stress is one of the causes of hair loss in men.
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Genetic causes ‚Äì This is one of the most common reasons for male pattern baldness, which may cause the well-known ‚ÄúU-shape‚Äù balding patch. This condition is passed by both sides of the family, and it‚Äôs not linked to stress as some might believe.</li>
                        <li>The age factor ‚Äì Men may lose more hair as they age. It is natural for hair to stop growing and volume to decrease.</li>
                        <li>Nutrition ‚Äì Remember your hair needs nutrients otherwise it will not grow healthy. Low iron levels, for example, or an unbalanced diet may cause temporary hair shedding.</li>
                        <li>Too much stress ‚Äì Although only one type of male hair loss may be caused by stress, there are times when men can suffer from an unexpected widespread thinning, particularly when under too much physical and emotional stress.</li>
                        <li>Wearing your hair up and too tight ‚Äì Ponytails, updos and parting can all put a lot of stress on the hair. You should avoid pulling your hair up with holders or tight elastics.</li>
                        <li>Conditions of the skin and scalp ‚Äì There is a condition called psoriasis, which some people may mistake for dandruff. The Mayo Clinic defines it: ‚ÄúPsoriasis‚Ä¶causes cells to build rapidly‚Ä¶forms scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.‚Äù Seborrheic dermatitis is another skin condition that affects the scalp and causes hair loss in large patches.</li>

This autoimmune disease attacks the immune system ‚Äì follicles become weak and die causing hair to come out. Some people may lose hair in a few spots while others will shed copious amounts of hair.

Also known as androgenetic alopecia, it is often caused by a genetic event where a male hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) will make the hair follicles become thinner and eventually wither away. Hair begins typically to recede at the front, and it becomes thinner on the top of the head until a bald patch forms in the scalp.

                        <li>Patchy bald spots ‚Äì It is common for some individuals to experience hair loss in some areas or bald spots, generally on the scalp, but it can also affect the eyebrows and beard. It can be itchy and painful before the hair falls out.</li>
                        <li>Unexpected loosening of hair ‚Äì Sometimes physical and emotional stress may cause hair to come out, mainly when combing or washing the hair. Nevertheless, patients will only experience hair thinning rather than bald patches.</li>
                        <li>Body hair loss ‚Äì There are some conditions as well as medical treatments, which may result in temporary shedding, but it normally grows back.</li>

                    The evaluation of a patient suffering from hair loss is a crucial step for a correct diagnosis of hair disease. The evaluation consists of a patient examination and clinical history followed by specific invasive and noninvasive tests. Doctors should invest the necessary time examining the patient. Patients, who understand their hair problem‚Äôs severity and progression, can adhere to <a href="https://care4hairmiami.com/hair-loss-treatment-options">hair loss treatment</a> and get the desired results. Also, the psychological impact of hair diseases should be carefully considered as some patients may be going through severe emotional distress.
                    <br><br>
                    Diagnosis of alopecia comprises both scarring and non-scarring conditions. A methodical approach is needed to meet the patient‚Äôs needs and achieve an accurate diagnosis. Scaring alopecia can be evaluated by a dermatologist. This condition is diagnosed by the appearance of the patch and precise identification of fungal agents.

                        <p>The average hair loss is 50 to 100 hairs every day. If you are shedding more hair than that, you should contact a trained professional to determine the hair loss causes and how you can deal with it.

                        <p>The first cause of hair loss is a condition called androgenic alopecia and the second one is age. The good news is there is something you can do about it.

                        <p>We can help you get your hair back with NeoGraft, a minimally invasive hair transplant technology with higher success rates. A good candidate for this procedure is any person in good health who wants a speedy recovery, and with sufficient donor hair thickness on their scalp. The NeoGraft FUE procedure is mostly performed on patients with moderate hair loss.

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Shampooing doesn‚Äôt cause hair to shed but rather it removes hairs ready to fall out. Likewise, coloring, perming, and conditioning should not promote shedding. Some specific styles, on the other hand, usually cause hair to fall out.

                        Are non-surgical hair restoration options effective??</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>It all depends on what your individual needs are. Although most non-surgical methods are faster and less costly than surgical options, they may only yield temporary results. The best way to find out which choice is right for you is by scheduling a consultation with a hair loss doctor.

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Low-level laser therapy or red light therapy uses infra-red laser beams to increase blood flow and stimulate hair growth. However, this system might not work for everyone, especially on patients experiencing significant hair loss. In other words, if you are bald, lasers will not work. This technology only thickens existing miniaturized hair.

                        <p>There are some circumstances which may trigger hair loss. They can affect the system that modifies hair growth. Consequently, as much as 40% of the hair may cycle into temporary thinning of hair, particularly in the front of the scalp. Some life events include unexpected weight loss, surgery, high fever, severe ailments, a loss, and divorce.
