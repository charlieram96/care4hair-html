                    Care4Hair offers women various hair restoration options. Not only can our female patients undergo a standard scalp hair transplant, but the doctor can graft hair for minor cosmetic purposes. Women trust our team of Miami hair specialists to change their forehead shapes, lower their hairlines, hide facelift or brow lift scars, and reshape their eyebrows.

                <ul>
                    <li>Scalp Hair Grafting: The standard hair restoration procedure at the Care4Hair clinic is scalp hair transplantation. Typically, our patients have exhausted all other reparation methods by the time they enter our Miami clinic. If a woman’s hair loss is not remediated with lifestyle changes or prescribed solutions, a hair transplant is the only option to achieve full, natural-looking results. The surgeon removes hair follicles from a donor area during a hair transplant and implants them into the balding recipient areas. The methods and technologies for this procedure vary, but each one yields permanent results.</li>

This hair loss causes the forehead to appear larger, uneven, and unnatural. Female patients who want a more youthful and balanced hairline or just a slight change in its overall shape can achieve the results they want at Care4Hair.

                <ul>
                    <li>Scar Revision and Hiding: A hair transplant easily conceals the residual scars of a facelift or brow lift that are usually visible at the edge of the hairline and temples. Therefore, by taking follicular units from a donor area of the head and placing them along the scarred area, the patient gains a more youthful hairline with no visible scarring from their previous cosmetic procedures.</li>

Since they greatly influence facial harmony, an eyebrow hair transplant is life-changing for individuals with sparse brows. Eyebrow hair is transplanted in the same way as it is on the scalp. The doctor removes donor hair from the back of the head or behind the ear and carefully implants it in the eyebrow area to grow in a natural-looking pattern. Patients can achieve the look they want in one non-invasive procedure.</li>

                    A woman must have enough donor hair in the back and sides of her head to fill the balding parts of her scalp or eyebrows. Therefore, patients with Diffuse Unpatterned Alopecia are not ideal candidates for a hair transplant since they usually do not have enough donor follicles to harvest. Care4hair also recommends that patients be a minimum of 25 years old, ideally between 30 and 50, which is when hair loss begins to stabilize.

                    Hair transplantation methods are the same for both men and women. However, female hair transplants require the skill of an experienced surgeon that understands how the hairline should frame the female face. Women’s hairlines are naturally positioned lower than men’s and must be fashioned to appear either rounder, more oval, or rectangular with softened corners. The doctor takes a woman’s face shape and proportions into account when designing a new hairline to ensure the most natural-looking results.

                The hair transplant recovery time varies depending on the chosen method and the body area being treated. Recovery from an FUE hair transplant procedure is reasonably short, as this technique does not require surgical incisions or stitching. Some patients return to work that same day while others take a day or two, or even an entire week off to focus on aftercare. The recovery process should not take longer than 7-10 days. However, it may take up to one year to see full, permanent results.
                <br><br>
                It is important to note that transplanted hair will go through a resting phase called “shock loss,” where the body sheds a few weeks after the procedure. While some patients do not experience this, most patients will as it is their body’s natural response to the surgery. Rest assured, even though the hair falls, the grafts remain healthy under the skin and will grow back in the months to follow if all aftercare instructions are heeded.

                            <li><span>The catagen phase</span>: The catagen phase begins when the anagen phase ends. This is a transitional stage that lasts about 2 to 3 weeks when the outer root of the hair stops growing, and the follicles shrink.
