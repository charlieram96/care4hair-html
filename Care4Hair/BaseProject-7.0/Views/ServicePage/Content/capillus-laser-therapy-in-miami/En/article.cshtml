For example, hair loss triggered by an autoimmune disorder or active pulling usually requires additional treatment.

                <p>
                    Capillus laser therapy uses energy in the form of photons pointed at the scalp to stimulate dormant or unhealthy hair follicles by increasing the hair shafts’ diameter. LLLT helps boost the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the hair follicles so that natural regrowth of thicker hair is fueled. Patients can wear the Capillus laser cap for half an hour every other day or 6 minutes each day to reach hair regrowth.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s important to have realistic expectations since the results can vary from patient to patient and they may not be immediate or permanent without consistency. The earlier you start this hair treatment, the more chances of success. Some patients may need to wait for 3 to 6 months of continuous use before seeing any significant hair regrowth.

                    Unlike other forms of LLLT, the Capillus laser cap is quite safe and effective. This device provides full and reliable exposure during treatment. It’s pain-free, non-evasive, and hands-free so you don’t even need to comb your hair. It doesn’t require going under the knife, and you don’t have to take any medications whether topical or oral.

                    As with any medical treatment, it is essential to consider the side effects before seeking treatment. We advise our patients to consult a licensed physician to find out about potential side effects related to the specific diagnosis and product they picked. Every product branded “Capillus” is not the same. Your doctor is the most appropriate person to handle any questions or concerns you may have.
                    <br><br>
                    Capillus laser therapy is a safe and useful non-surgical hair restoration option with no known side effects except than avoiding contact with the eye. The light emitted will not cause your skin to burn, and you will not suffer any other side effects. However, individuals experiencing health conditions or disorders should talk to their physician before using LLLT.

                Patients can use Capillus laser therapy after hair restoration surgery. It can help with wound healing, discomfort, and inflammation. Many surgeons recommend Capillus for recovery and prevention of persistent hair loss. Every case is different, so it’s important you contact your doctor for his opinion as every surgeon has different post-op care instructions. At large, LLLT is safe to use after surgery. This technology has been used in physical therapy as it can improve circulation and healing throughout the body.
